This is a simple temperature controller using an arduino bootloaded atmega328p, a 16x2 LCD display, and a ds18b20 temperature sensor.  Comments, questions or concerns can be emailed to planecrazy29@gmail.com

This is my first attempt at a project of this type including figuring out github, so please let me know if I do something wrong or you can help me make it better.  Thanks.
